# Scientific Computing Assignment

This repo contains the four parts for the first Scentific Computing Assignment, which required the following:

* Use a centered-difference approximation to estimate the first derivative of a given function with varying values of h to demonstrate the validity of the a given error analysis
* Develop a predator-prey model where humans hunt both predator and prey equally
* Solving the n-Queens problem using a parallel search
* Solving the n-Queens problem using a sequential search
